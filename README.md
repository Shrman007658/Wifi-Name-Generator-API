# WifiNameGenerator-API

Everyone knows its a painful job to comeup with wifi names by yourself. So I went out and added a few.  
This is a very simple API for generating classy and funny wifi names. 

This API returns a new Wifi name for every GET request you send to it. 

#Want to run this? 
Fork it into your local disk and run "npm install".
