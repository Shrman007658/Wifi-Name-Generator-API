# WifiNameGenerator-API

Everyone knows its a painful job to comeup with wifi names by yourself. So I went out and added a few.  
This is a very simple API for generating classy and funny wifi names. 

This API returns a new Wifi name for every GET request you send to it. 

# Want to run this? 
Fork it into your local disk and run "npm install". 
Or go over to https://arcane-sea-11213.herokuapp.com/. 

You can even send GET requests to this endpoint in POSTMAN or similar applications :)


# Contributors
If you are a contributor and would love to contribute, be it to the readme or adding new code. You can even add new Wifinames! 
However please fork the dev branch and not the master branch. 

Also if you like this API, please star it <3

Happy Naming!
